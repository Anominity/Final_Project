## Context

#### Business intelligence and data-driven decision making

- How can we improve productivity within Scotland and the UK overall?
  - How does the UK compare to other developed economies in terms of GDP and exports?
  - What factors might be important in predicting a countryâ€™s GDP?
  - Can you predict GDP estimates/growth for the upcoming year(s) from any of these factors?

<br>

#### Domain knowledge and the business context

The aim for Deloitte is to identify key areas which affect GDP and productivity within the UK and especially those which lag behind other developed nations, with the aim being to potentially target and improve these aspects in order to "keep up" with those nations.

This is important to Deloitte as a financial services company as any improvements in Productivity or GDP will have direct feedback into an improved market in Financial services.

Using this analysis I aim to investigate and identify some key areas and show their correlations with GDP and Productivity.

## Data

In this analysis I have used a number of datasets:  
  
GDP_three_approaches00-21.csv   
 - 44960 observations x 17 variables  

population_10-19.csv   
 - 62586 observations x 11 variables  

education_enrolment_age.csv    
 - 105222 observations x 15 variables  

gdp_quarterly_10-17.csv  
 - 2368 observations x 19 variables  

pop_employ_10-17.csv  
 - 4442 observations x 19 variables  

employment_by_industry_10-17.csv   
 - 36248 observations x 19 variables  

imp_exports_value.csv   
 - 84924 observations x 19 variables  

These documents were obtained externally from the OECD statistics databases at:

https://stats.oecd.org/#


#### Types of data

The documents are arranged in Categorical, Numerical and Time Series.

#### Data formats

The files were all downloaded in .CSV file format.

#### Data quality and bias

Different concepts and basic statistical sources are used across countries, which can hinder international comparability. This needs to be taken into account when reviewing the findings of this analysis.

## Ethics


As the data is all broad demographical data, there is no personally identifiable information.

#### Ethical implications of business requirements

I do not feel there are any ethical implications of the business requirements as it is a very broad analysis.

## Analysis

#### Stages in the data analysis process

What were the main stages in your data analysis process?

The steps towards my analysis were as follows:  

- Read in data.  

- Clean Datasets  
  - Remove erroneous variables  
  - Pivot datasets accordingly  
  - Filter out of scope entries  
  - Rename fields  

- Join Datasets together  

- Data Wrangling  
  - Wrangle data to be more consistent (ie, Population in industry figures, to proportions of population)  
  - Group fields together (ie, Age to Age groups etc.)   

- Visualisation of Data  
  - Extract key points in data via plots  

- Machine Learning  
  - Test / Train split  
  - Establish a workable model on train  
  - Validate model on Test   
  - K-Fold Validation  

- Concerns & Conclusions  

<br>

#### Tools for data analysis

For my analysis I used the following: 

- RStudio 2022.07.1 Build 554  
- R version 4.2.0  
  
R packages:   

- tidyverse  
- janitor  
- zoo  
- ggpairs   
- ggfortify  
- ggrepel  
- infer  
- glmulti  
- modelr  
- caret

#### Types of Analysis


My Analysis falls under Descriptive, Prescriptive and a little Predictive Analysis.

Descriptive was in the attempting to ascertain what key factors were influencing GDP in the past.

Prescriptive in suggesting ways in which GDP growth could be potentially improved.

Predictive with a few notes on the challenges of predicting GDP.
